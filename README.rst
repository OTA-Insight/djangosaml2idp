djangosaml2idp implements the Identity Provider side of the SAML2 protocol for Django.
It builds on top of `PySAML2 <https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2>`_, and is production-ready.

Package version 0.3.3 was the last Python 2 / Django 1.8-1.11 compatible release. Versions starting from 0.4.0 are for Python 3 and Django 2.x.

Any contributions, feature requests, proposals, ideas ... are welcome! See the `CONTRIBUTING document <https://github.com/OTA-Insight/djangosaml2idp/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ for some info.

Installation
============

PySAML2 uses `XML Security Library <http://www.aleksey.com/xmlsec/>`_ binary to sign SAML assertions, so you need to install
it either through your operating system package or by compiling the source code. It doesn't matter where the final executable is installed because
you will need to set the full path to it in the configuration stage. XmlSec is available (at least) for Debian, OSX and Alpine Linux.

Now you can install the djangosaml2idp package using pip. This will also install PySAML2 and its dependencies automatically::

    pip install djangosaml2idp


Configuration & Usage
=====================

The first thing you need to do is add ``djangosaml2idp`` to the list of installed apps::

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        'django.contrib.admin',
        'djangosaml2idp',
        ...
    )

Now include ``djangosaml2idp`` in your project by adding it in the url config::

    from django.conf.urls import url, include
    from django.contrib import admin

    urlpatterns = [
        url(r'^idp/', include('djangosaml2idp.urls')),
        url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
        ...
    ]

In your Django settings, configure your IdP. Configuration follows the `PySAML2 configuration <https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2/blob/master/docs/howto/config.rst>`_. The IdP from the example project looks like this::

    ...
    import saml2
    from saml2.saml import NAMEID_FORMAT_EMAILADDRESS, NAMEID_FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED
    from saml2.sigver import get_xmlsec_binary

    LOGIN_URL = '/login/'
    BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:9000/idp'

    SAML_IDP_CONFIG = {
        'debug' : DEBUG,
        'xmlsec_binary': get_xmlsec_binary(['/opt/local/bin', '/usr/bin/xmlsec1']),
        'entityid': '%s/metadata' % BASE_URL,
        'description': 'Example IdP setup',

        'service': {
            'idp': {
                'name': 'Django localhost IdP',
                'endpoints': {
                    'single_sign_on_service': [
                        ('%s/sso/post' % BASE_URL, saml2.BINDING_HTTP_POST),
                        ('%s/sso/redirect' % BASE_URL, saml2.BINDING_HTTP_REDIRECT),
                    ],
                },
                'name_id_format': [NAMEID_FORMAT_EMAILADDRESS, NAMEID_FORMAT_UNSPECIFIED],
                'sign_response': True,
                'sign_assertion': True,
            },
        },

        'metadata': {
            'local': [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'idp', 'saml2_config', 'sp_metadata.xml')],
        },
        # Signing
        'key_file': BASE_DIR + '/certificates/private.key',
        'cert_file': BASE_DIR + '/certificates/public.cert',
        # Encryption
        'encryption_keypairs': [{
            'key_file': BASE_DIR + '/certificates/private.key',
            'cert_file': BASE_DIR + '/certificates/public.cert',
        }],
        'valid_for': 365 * 24,
    }


Notice the configuration requires a private key and public certificate to be available on the filesystem in order to sign and encrypt messages.


You also have to define a mapping for each SP you talk to. An example SP config::

    ...
    SAML_IDP_SPCONFIG = {
        'http://localhost:8000/saml2/metadata/': {
            'processor': 'djangosaml2idp.processors.BaseProcessor',
            'nameid_field': 'staffID'
            'sign_response': False,
            'sign_assertion': False,
            'attribute_mapping': {
                # DJANGO: SAML
                'email': 'email',
                'first_name': 'first_name',
                'last_name': 'last_name',
                'is_staff': 'is_staff',
                'is_superuser':  'is_superuser',
                'callable_to_get_id': 'calculate_id',  # assuming <user_instance>.calculate_id() is a method
            }
        },
        # ...
        # config of additional Service Providers
        # ...
    }

Please note that the only required field for each SP is the Entity ID, which is the key for each individual SP config dict. The bare minimum is setting ``SAML_IDP_CONFIG[Your Entity Id] = {}``.
Also, ``attribute_mapping`` will default to ``{'username': 'username'}``.
If you would like to not send any attributes to the SP, set ``attribute_mapping`` to an empty dict (``{}``).
You can provide object attributes or callables names on the Django side in the attribute mapping. The callable needs to be a method on the object accepts 1 parameter (self), don't put parentheses in the attribute mapping.

If you want to override ``sign_assertion`` and/or ``sign_response`` for individual SPs, you can do so in ``SAML_IDP_SPCONFIG``, as seen above. If unset, these will default to the values set in ``SAML_IDP_CONFIG``.


The last step is configuring metadata.
Download a copy of the IdP's metadata from <YOUR_SERVER_URL>/idp/metadata (assuming that's how you set up your urls.py). Use it to configure your SPs as required by them.
Obtain a copy of the metadata for each of your SPs, and upload them where you indicated in ``SAML_IDP_CONFIG['metadata]``

Further optional configuration options
======================================

In the ``SAML_IDP_SPCONFIG`` setting you can define a ``processor``, its value being a string with dotted path to a class.
This is a hook to customize some access control checks. By default, the included `BaseProcessor` is used, which allows every user to login on the IdP.
You can customize this behaviour by subclassing the `BaseProcessor` and overriding its `has_access(self, request)` method. This method should return true or false, depending if the user has permission to log in for the SP / IdP.
The processor has the SP entity ID available as `self._entity_id`, and received the request (with an authenticated request.user on it) as parameter to the `has_access` function.
This way, you should have the necessary flexibility to perform whatever checks you need.
An example `processor subclass <https://github.com/OTA-Insight/djangosaml2idp/blob/master/example_setup/idp/idp/processors.py>`_ can be found in the IdP of the included example.
Use this metadata xml to configure your SP. Place the metadata xml from that SP in the location specified in the config dict (sp_metadata.xml in the example above).

Without custom setting, users will be identified by the ``USERNAME_FIELD`` property on the user Model you use. By Django defaults this will be the username.
You can customize which field is used for the identifier by adding ``SAML_IDP_DJANGO_USERNAME_FIELD`` to your settings with as value the attribute to use on your user instance.
You can also override this per SP by setting ``nameid_field`` in the SP config, as seen in the sample ``SAML_IDP_SPCONFIG`` above.

Customizing error handling
==========================

djangosaml2idp renders a very basic error page if it encounters an error, indicating an error occured, which error, and possibly an extra message.
The HTTP status code is dependant on which error occured. It also logs the exception with error severity.
You can customize this by using the ``SAML_IDP_ERROR_VIEW_CLASS`` setting. Set this to a dotted import path to your custom (class based) view in order to use that one.
You'll likely want this to use your own template and styling to display and error message.
If you subclass the provided `djangosaml2idp.error_views.SamlIDPErrorView`, you have the following variables available for use in the template:

exception
  the exception instance that occurred

exception_type
  the class of the exception that occurred

exception_msg
  the message from the exception (by doing `str(exception)`)

extra_message
  if no specific exception given, a message indicating something went wrong, or an additional message next to the `exception_msg`

The simplest override is to subclass the `SamlIDPErrorView` and only using your own error template.
You can use any Class-Based-View for this; it's not necessary to subclass the builtin error view.
The example project contains a ready to use example of this; uncomment the `SAML_IDP_ERROR_VIEW_CLASS` setting and it will use a custom view with custom template.


Multi Factor Authentication support
===================================

There are three main components to adding multiple factor support.


1. Subclass djangosaml2idp.processors.BaseProcessor as outlined above. You will need to override the `enable_multifactor()` method to check whether or not multifactor should be enabled for a user. (If it should allways be enabled for all users simply hard code to True). By default it unconditionally returns False and no multifactor is enforced.

2. Sublass the `djangosaml2idp.views.ProcessMultiFactorView` view to make the appropriate calls for your environment. Implement your custom verification logic in the `multifactor_is_valid` method: this could call a helper script, an internal SMS triggering service, a data source only the IdP can access or an external second factor provider (e.g. Symantec VIP). By default this view will log that it was called then redirect.

3. Add an entry to settings.py with a string representing the path to your multifactor view. The first package should be the app name:
`SAML_IDP_MULTIFACTOR_VIEW = "this.is.the.path.to.your.multifactor.view`


Running the test suite
======================
Install the dev dependencies in ``requirements-dev.txt``::

  pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

Run ``py.test`` from the project root::

  py.test



Example project
---------------
The directory ``example_project`` contains a barebone demo setup to demonstrate the login-logout functionality.
It consists of a Service Provider implemented with `djangosaml2 <https://github.com/knaperek/djangosaml2/>`_ and an Identity Provider using ``djangosaml2idp``.
The readme in that folder contains more information on how to run it.
